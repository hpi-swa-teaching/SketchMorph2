The sole purpose of this class is to copy all relevant icon methods from UiFugueIcons class 
into our project.
This workaround is necessary as the remote package 'http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/hirschfeld/squeaksource/SwaUtilities' cannot be reached reliably.

For more information about the icons used see UiFugueIcons.
