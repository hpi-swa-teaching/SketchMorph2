The backend of SketchMorph2. Uses a Form to store image data in a bitmap. Can be created by a Frontend to display that data.
Stores the current modus (#pen - #geometric) to adapt behaviour depending on current tool.
When the geometric mode is selected the geometric form is specified by currentGeometricForm (#circle, #rectangle)
