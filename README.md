# SketchMorph2
Sketching tool for Squeak. Offers a flexible backend through image form manipulation and friendly usage with a Morphic frontend.

## How to Install
Install as you would any SAR file: Drag and drop into your squeak image.

## Usage
Open the frontend by executing ```MorphicMonet open```.\
A window will open offering you a blank canvas to draw on and a selection of tools to use. Most of these tools work as you would expect from other digital drawing systems. You can choose a color from the predefined palette or freely from the color selector.
